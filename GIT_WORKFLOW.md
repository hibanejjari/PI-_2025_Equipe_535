# Working with Git: Pulling & Pushing to Your Own Branch

When contributing to this project, we should create and use **our own branch** instead of working directly on `main`.

## 1. Clone the repository (first time only)

Choose a folder on your machine where you want the project to live (for example, `Documents/Projects/`).  
Run these commands in your terminal (PowerShell, Git Bash, or Linux shell):

```
git clone https://github.com/hibanejjari/PI-_2025_Equipe_535.git
cd PI-_2025_Equipe_535
```

This will:
- **Download (clone)** the repository from GitHub to your computer.  
- **Enter the project folder** so you can start working inside it.  

## 2. Create and switch to your own branch
Replace `<your-branch>` with a meaningful name (use your name or the feature youâ€™re working on):
```
git checkout -b <your-branch>
```

## 3. Pull the latest changes from `main`
Before pushing your updates, always make sure your branch is up to date with the `main` branch:
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout <your-branch>
git merge main
```

## 4. Stage and commit your changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature or fix"
```

## 5. Push your branch to GitHub
```
git push origin <your-branch>
```

## 6. Open a Pull Request
- Go to the repository on GitHub: [PI-_2025_Equipe_535](https://github.com/hibanejjari/PI-_2025_Equipe_535).  
- Select your branch and click **New Pull Request**.  
- Once reviewed and approved by the whole team, it will be merged into `main`.
